{"workshopId":2264422885,"Title":"Clever Girl","Description":"Clever Girl, a mod for Caves of Qud that lets your followers manage their own\r\n[list]\r\n[*]Gear\r\n[*]Skills\r\n[*]Mutations\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\nThe entry point of the mod is the interact menu with your acquired followers. In addition to the usual \"chat\", \"give items\", etc. commands, you'll now be able to \"enable gear pickup\", \"manage skills\", and \"manage mutations\".\r\n\r\n[h1]Managing gear[/h1]\r\nIf your follower has gear pickup enabled, anytime they aren't otherwise occupied (e.g. in combat), they will go pick up any gear they see lying on the ground that's better than what they're wearing and equip it. They can also drop things on the ground if they become overburdened, so be careful with your pack mules.\r\n\r\n[h1]Managing skills[/h1]\r\nThe list shows all Skills categories available for your follower to learn, as well as how many Powers they've acquired from each of those categories. Your follower will spend newly-acquired skill points intelligently* among the categories you select for learning.\r\n\r\n[h1]Managing mutations[/h1]\r\nThe list shows all Mutations your follower has and their levels, as well as an option to \"Acquire new mutations\". Every mutation point they gain will be intelligently* distributed among the mutations you select for advancement and saving for new mutations. When they have enough to buy a new mutation, you'll get the standard choice of three for them.\r\n\r\n* randomly\r","Tags":"followers","Visibility":"1","ImagePath":"preview.png"}
